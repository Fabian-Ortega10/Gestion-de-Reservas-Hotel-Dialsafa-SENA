# Hotel Reservation Management System – Backend (Python)

Backend system developed in Python to manage hotel reservations, customers, and room availability.  
The project focuses on clear business logic, maintainable code, and the application of good software development practices.

This repository is part of an academic–personal initiative aimed at simulating real-world backend scenarios commonly found in hospitality businesses.

## Problem Statement

Small and medium-sized hotels often rely on manual processes or poorly structured systems to manage reservations.  
This can result in overbooking, inconsistent data, and difficulties in tracking room availability and customer information.

The objective of this project is to build a backend solution that centralizes reservation management and enforces clear business rules to ensure data consistency and future scalability.

---

## Solution Overview

This backend application provides functionalities such as:

- Reservation management
- Customer registration and tracking
- Room availability control
- Validation of business rules related to booking dates and availability

The solution is designed with a strong emphasis on business logic separation, code readability, and long-term maintainability.

## Architecture and Design

The project follows a layered structure inspired by clean architecture principles:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and rules
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and business workflows
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Data persistence and external dependencies
- **Interface Layer**: Entry points to the system (controllers or handlers)

Design principles applied:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Separation of concerns
- Expressive and meaningful naming

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Architecture:** Layered architecture oriented to clean code  
- **Database:** Relational database (SQL)  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
